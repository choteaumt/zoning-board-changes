[153.50 Purpose](https://choteau.municipalcodeonline.com/book?type=ordinances#name=153.50_Purpose)

The general purpose of this chapter is to set forth standards for property development, maintenance, and use that may, and usually do, apply to several districts. Standards for parking, landscaping, measurement of setbacks and height, and property maintenance not only will apply to almost every district established by these regulations, but they will contribute substantially to the preservation and enhancement of the city’s special character and qualities.

(Prior Code, § 9-4-1) (Ord. 304, passed 4-10-2012)  

[153.51 Landscaping Standards](https://choteau.municipalcodeonline.com/book?type=ordinances#name=153.51_Landscaping_Standards)

1.  _Purpose and intent_. This section sets forth the standards and policies for the design, planting, and maintenance of all required landscape areas within the city. The planting of trees and other landscape materials serves to preserve and stabilize property values and enhance the built environment of the city. Trees in particular are recognized for their importance in shading and cooling, noise and wind reduction, open space, visual relief, architectural enhancement, prevention of soil erosion, production of oxygen, dust filtration, carbon dioxide uptake, providing habitat for urban wildlife, and contributing to the aesthetic and economic value of real property. Landscape areas that are specially designed to act as drainage retention and snow storage areas are encouraged by the city.
2.  _Applicability_. The standards set forth herein apply to all required landscaped areas within the city. Area required to be landscaped is set by each zoning district as a “landscape ratio” or LSR. In addition to the required landscape area, each property owner must also landscape and maintain the parkway area of the street right-of-way that lies between the front property line and the curb, pavement, or attached sidewalk as applicable. One- and two-family residential properties and parking areas with four or fewer spaces are not subject to the landscape standards contained in this section, but are required to provide landscaped areas as required by other applicable sections of this code of ordinances.
3.  _Landscape plan required_.
    1.  For each development where landscaping is required under this Zoning Code, a landscape plan shall be submitted as part of the application for a zoning permit. Landscaping that meets the standards of this section, as well as the applicable zoning district, is required for all new development and redevelopment. Landscape plans shall be drawn to scale and shall include:
        1.  Symbols for each type and species of plant proposed;
        2.  Area in square feet of each part of the site to be landscaped;
        3.  A legend specifying the number and installed size of each type of plant material;
        4.  Planting details (depth, growth medium, staking, balled and burlap, and the like (see example below); and
        5.  Irrigation plan.  
              
            ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/municipalcodeonline.com-new/choteau/ADC/images/ordinance/1647629436_Choteau,%20MT%201.png)
    2.  Typical planting detail for a multi-stem tree or shrub. This particular detail does not include soil amendment, but soil amendment is recommended for the Choteau area.
4.  _Nonconforming properties_.
    1.  Properties that do not meet the landscape standards set forth in this chapter, but which were legally developed prior to the effective date of this chapter, may continue as legally nonconforming properties. However, additional landscaping toward meeting the standards of this chapter shall be required in the event of:
        1.  The use of the property changing from one permitted use to another;
        2.  The use of the property changing from a permitted use to a special use;
        3.  An additional structure is constructed on the subject property;
        4.  The existing floor area of all structures on the property is increased by 25% or more; and
        5.  The parking area is paved and/or reconstructed.
    2.  The amount and extent of additional landscaping required on nonconforming properties shall be to the extent practicable as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
5.  _Selection of plant materials_. All plant materials should be selected for their hardiness and survivability in the Choteau area, which is in USDA Zone 4. Specimen trees and ornamentals should be selected from the tree list provided in Appendix A of the City’s Master Forestry Plan.
6.  _Minimum installed sizes_. All landscape materials must meet at least the minimum installed sizes set forth below. Trees and plants recommended for USDA plant hardiness Zone 3b are preferred.
    1.  Coniferous specimen trees (Austrian pine, blue spruce, Douglas fir, and the like): eight feet as measured from ground surface;
    2.  Deciduous specimen trees (red oak, quaking aspen, Patmore ash, green ash, maple, and the like): two and one-half inch caliper as measured one foot above the ground surface;
    3.  Ornamentals, multi-stem trees/shrubs (multi-stem aspen, amur maple, Russian olive, Walker weeping caragana, mountain ash, crabapple, and the like): five feet as measured from ground surface;
    4.  Shrubs (potentilla, dwarf Arctic willow, snowberry, serviceberry, red twig dogwood, and the like): five-gallon containers;
    5.  Ground covers (kinnikinik, sweetfern, cliff green, Tammy juniper, and the like): three-gallon containers. Rock, bark, and similar materials are suitable for planting beds, but not as a general ground cover; and
    6.  Turf; seeding or sodding of turf grass areas are both permitted; grasses should be drought tolerant such as buffalo grass, blue grama, wheatgrass, and the like. Rock, bark, and similar materials may not be substituted for turf grass.
7.  _Planting standards and guidelines_. This division (G) contains standards and guidelines for the number and installed size of plant materials for each type of landscape area.
    1.  _General guidelines_. For each 1,200 square feet of landscaped area, the following plant materials should be provided. Except for specimen trees, the quantities of plant materials are guidelines, and varying of these guidelines to accommodate the unique features of a development site is encouraged. However, specimen trees are required as set forth below:
        1.  One specimen tree. No more than 75% of the required specimen trees shall be either conifer or deciduous;
        2.  Two ornamental trees;
        3.  Three large shrubs/multi-stems; and
        4.  Ground cover and/or turf as appropriate.
    2.  _Planting strips_. When landscape areas consist of strips no less than six feet and no more than 12 feet in width (such as in setbacks and adjacent to parking areas), the standards set forth in this subsection shall be applied. Because planting strips have their own set of unique standards, their area may be subtracted from the landscape area that is subject to the general guidelines and standards above.
        1.  One specimen tree for each 40 linear feet of strip. Trees may be either deciduous or coniferous, as appropriate for the application. Trees need not be uniformly spaced, but may be grouped to present a more natural looking landscape.
        2.  One ornamental tree for each 25 linear feet. Ornamentals may also be grouped or clustered for a more natural look.
        3.  Adjacent to parking areas, car height screening is required. One shrub or multi-stem for each ten linear feet shall be provided, and may be clustered for a natural affect. Bark or mulch may be used for the shrub bed. For strips in side or rear setbacks that do not screen parking, shrubs are not required.
    3.  _Parking lot landscaping_. This term refers to landscaping within the parking area itself.
        1.  _Landscape islands_. Landscape islands shall be provided at least every ten parking spaces (20 spaces for a head to head arrangement). Islands shall be the approximate length of the adjacent parking space(s) and shall be at least eight feet in width. At least one deciduous specimen tree is required per island and the use of conifers is highly discouraged. The specimen tree should be selected so that it does not cause a visibility hazard to motorists as they maneuver in the parking area. Four shrubs not to exceed three and one-half feet in height as measured from the driving surface are also required in each island.
        2.  _Landscape strips (between parking rows)_. The use of landscape strips that separate two rows of parking spaces is discouraged.
8.  _Installation, phasing, and surety_. Generally, landscaping shall be installed prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy (CO). If no CO is required, installation must take place prior to occupancy (residential) or opening (nonresidential). Exceptions for landscape phasing and for building occupancy during seasons of the year not conducive to planting are set forth below.
    1.  Should any project for which landscaping is required be completed and ready for occupancy between October 1 and April 15, landscape installation may be postponed until such time as weather and soil conditions allow for efficient installation and the best chance for survival of plant materials. Occupancy or opening of a project may be allowed by the city upon the posting of a surety (bond or letter of credit) equal to 110% of the estimated cost of the landscape installation.
    2.  For development projects of two acres or more, landscaping may be phased over two planting seasons, provided that at least 50% of the required landscaping is installed during the first season prior to opening or occupancy as set forth in division (H)(1) above. In that event, a surety shall be provided equal to 110% of the estimated cost of the remaining landscaping.
9.  _Maintenance and removal of dead and diseased plant materials_. All required landscaping is required to be maintained in a park-like condition as it was originally approved. All diseased or dead plant materials must be replaced during the current or next planting season as applicable. Substitute plant species (a different species than was shown on the original approved landscape plan) may be approved by the Zoning Administrator upon request. Failure to maintain required landscaping is deemed a violation of this chapter.

[153.52 Property Maintenance](https://choteau.municipalcodeonline.com/book?type=ordinances#name=153.52_Property_Maintenance)

Property maintenance standards are intended to protect neighborhood quality, character, and property values by eliminating public health, safety, and nuisance issues associated with the accumulation of junk, debris, and the substandard maintenance of buildings and structures.

1.  _Inoperable vehicles and parts_. Inoperable vehicles or parts of vehicles, including, but not limited to, auto and truck bodies, boats, trailers, motorcycles, snowmobiles, RVs, engines, tires, rims, transmissions, and the like, may not be stored openly, except that when a vehicle is actively being restored or repaired, the vehicle itself may be stored outdoors for no more than 30 days.
2.  _Trash and debris_. No trash or debris shall be allowed to accumulate on properties, including, but not necessarily limited to, garbage, rubbish, ashes, yard and garden waste, tree trimmings, packaging, broken concrete or asphalt, furniture, appliances, scrap wood, demolition waste, building materials, and the like.
3.  _Organic waste_. Accumulation of organic waste is expressly prohibited and such wastes must be disposed of immediately. Organic waste includes, but is not necessarily limited to, septic tank pumpage, sludge, sewage of any kind, waste food items, dead animals and animal parts of any kind, manure, and the like. Compost bins are allowed provided that they are restricted to side and rear yard areas, odors are undetectable from adjacent properties, and that they do not attract wildlife.
4.  _Building condition and maintenance_. All buildings and structures shall be kept in a sound and livable condition and properly maintained, including siding, roofing, paint or stain, decks, porches, balconies, and windows, including screens and sashes. Structures are not permitted to remain in an obvious partially constructed state without continuous progress being made to complete the structure.
5.  _Building construction_. During construction, all building materials and construction waste must be contained on site. Outdoor burning of waste building materials is not permitted within the city limits.

[153.53 Home-Based Businesses](https://choteau.municipalcodeonline.com/book?type=ordinances#name=153.53_Home-Based_Businesses)

A home-based business is a nonresidential accessory and incidental use of residential property. Typically, it is a business operated from a home with part of the floor area of the residential unit and/or an accessory structure devoted to the business. This Zoning Code recognizes two types of home-based businesses: home occupations and cottage industries.

1.  _Home occupations_. The following standards and conditions apply to home occupations.
    1.  Home occupations are conducted entirely within the primary dwelling unit and/or in an attached garage, provided that at least the minimum number of required parking spaces is maintained. Home occupations are not allowed to operate in a detached accessory structure of any kind. Home occupations may be operated from a single-family detached residence, duplex, townhome, or multi-family dwelling unit.
    2.  No more than 25% of the floor area of the primary dwelling may be used for the home occupation. (Note: floor area of an attached garage may not be counted toward the allowable floor area for the home occupation.)
    3.  There may be no outward appearance or visible evidence that a home occupation is being conducted on site, except for signage permitted by division (A)(5) below.
    4.  No outdoor storage is permitted with the exception of one boat, trailer, RV, ATV, and the like, that is used in the operation of the home occupation. Such storage is not permitted in the front yard area of the primary residence, but may be located in a driveway, provided all required off-street parking spaces are maintained.
    5.  One sign no greater than six square feet is allowed. Said sign must be wall-mounted to the primary structure and is subject to a sign permit.
    6.  Home occupations are conducted solely by the resident or residents of the dwelling, including any ARUs. No one living off-site may be employed on the premises.
    7.  No traffic shall be generated by any home occupation greater than what would normally be expected in a residential neighborhood. Any delivery and supply vehicles shall be no larger than those that normally make deliveries to residential neighborhoods. Retail sales conducted on premises are expressly prohibited as a home occupation. Retail sales may take place via telecommunications with merchandise sent out by common carrier.
    8.  No home occupation may impact adjacent residential properties with noise, smoke, glare, fumes, dust, or odors in excess of that which is typical of a dwelling unit.
    9.  No home occupation shall cause visual or audible interference in any radio or television receivers off premises, or cause fluctuations in line voltage off premises.
    10.  Home occupations that meet the standards of this division (A) may operate as permitted uses in all residential districts. A business license from the city may be required.
2.  _Cottage industries_. The following standards and conditions apply to cottage industries.
    1.  Cottage industries may be conducted by any member(s) of the household or residents of any ARU on the subject property. In addition, up to two persons who do not reside on the premises may be employed on premises in the cottage industry.
    2.  One off-street parking space for each employee not residing on premises must be provided. Said parking shall be in a driveway or to the side or rear of the primary residence.
    3.  The minimum lot area for a cottage industry shall be 10,000 square feet, and the associated residence must be a single-family detached dwelling unit.
    4.  The maximum floor area devoted to the cottage industry shall not exceed 50% of the floor area of the primary residence on the subject property.
    5.  The cottage industry may be conducted in the home, in an attached garage (provided that at least the minimum number of required parking spaces is maintained), or in an accessory structure that conforms to the standards of the applicable zoning district.
    6.  No outdoor storage is permitted with the exception of two boats, trailers, RVs, ATVs, and the like, that are used in the operation of the cottage industry. Such storage is not permitted in the front yard area of the primary residence.
    7.  Two signs are permitted for a cottage industry. One sign may be mounted on a wooden post(s) in the front yard of the primary residence. This sign may be no more than four feet in height and six square feet per side in area. The second sign shall be mounted flat to the wall of the structure in which the cottage industry is conducted and near the entryway. This sign shall not exceed two square feet in area.
    8.  No cottage industry may impact adjacent residential properties with noise, smoke, glare, fumes, dust, or odors in excess of that which is typical of a dwelling unit.
    9.  No cottage industry shall cause visual or audible interference in any radio or television receivers off premises, or cause fluctuations in line voltage off premises.
    10.  Other than employees as allowed in this subsection, no traffic shall be generated by any cottage industry greater than what would normally be expected in a residential neighborhood. Any delivery and supply vehicles shall be no larger than those that normally make deliveries to residential neighborhoods. Retail sales are expressly prohibited as a cottage industry.
    11.  Cottage industries are subject to a home business permit issued by the City Council. Anyone seeking to initiate a cottage industry shall submit an application on a form provided by the city, including an accurate site plan of the subject property drawn to a suitable scale (one inch = ten feet, one inch = 20 feet, and the like). The application shall include the signatures of all adjacent property owners that they have been notified of the proposed cottage industry. An application fee shall be set by resolution of the City Council. The City Council may act to approve, disapprove, or approve the application with conditions, at any regular meeting for which the agenda is published in the city’s newspaper of record. A business license from the city may also be required. Any cottage industry that is initiated without a home business permit and/or a business license if so required, is deemed in violation of these regulations.

[153.54 Prevailing Front Setback Provision](https://choteau.municipalcodeonline.com/book?type=ordinances#name=153.54_Prevailing_Front_Setback_Provision)

For residential structures in the A and B Residential Zoning Districts only, the applicant has the option of using the front setback prescribed for the applicable district, or, the prevailing setback provision may be used as set forth in this section.

1.  In lieu of the prescribed front setback, the applicant may reduce the required setback by using the mean setback of the four closest dwellings on the same side of the street.
2.  The applicant is responsible for obtaining accurate measurements of the four nearest residential structures and presenting them to the Zoning Administrator along with the application for a zoning permit.
3.  The applicant may use any dimension between the prescribed front setback and the mean of the four nearest dwelling units. (Example: Prescribed front setback is 16 feet. The mean front setback of the four nearest dwelling units is ten feet. The applicant may use any dimension between ten feet and 16 feet for the front setback.)
4.  Where a maximum front setback is specified, it may not be varied through this process.

(Prior Code, § 9-4-5) (Ord. 304, passed 4-10-2012)  

[153.55 Structural Height Measurement](https://choteau.municipalcodeonline.com/book?type=ordinances#name=153.55_Structural_Height_Measurement)

The “height of a structure” is defined as the distance from the highest point of a roof to the nearest point of finished or natural grade, whichever one is applicable. Structural height is further determined as follows.

1.  _Highest point of a structu_re. The highest point of a structure is the top of the highest roof pitch for a hip or gabled roof, or top of parapet for a flat roof not including any mechanical structures. Steeples, chimneys, antennas, receiving dishes, and the like, are not subject to limitations of structural height, except cell towers which are limited to 50 feet in height.
2.  _Finished grade_. Finished grade shall be construed as the grade at the base or foundation of a structure necessary to achieve positive drainage away from the structure only. Soil, fill, or other material may not be bermed against a structure to circumvent height limits.
3.  _Natural grade_. Natural grade shall be construed as meaning that the natural slope and topography of the land need little or no modification to site the structure. Where the nearest two points to natural grade are at different grades (such as, a house that takes up grade through the structure), the heights measured may be averaged.

[153.56 Setback Measurements And Allowable Encroachments](https://choteau.municipalcodeonline.com/book?type=ordinances#name=153.56_Setback_Measurements_And_Allowable_Encroachments)

1.  _Front setbacks_.
    1.  A required front setback is measured at a right angle (90 degrees) from the front property line to the nearest of the following two points on the structure:
        1.  The foundation wall of the principal structure; or
        2.  The facing edge of a porch or deck over 16 square feet in area extending from the front of the principal structure.
    2.  The following encroachments into the front setback are allowed:
        1.  Steps are allowed to encroach into the required front setback up to eight feet;
        2.  Ramps to provide accessibility to disabled persons may encroach up to 100%, but may not encroach onto the public right-of-way without special authorization from the holder of said right-of-way;
        3.  Eaves may encroach up to two feet; and
        4.  Porches and decks not exceeding 16 square feet in total area may encroach up to four feet.
2.  _Side setbacks_. A required side setback is measured at a right angle (90 degrees) from the side lot line to the nearest point of the foundation wall. Chimneys, eaves, bay windows no more than eight feet in total length, and garden windows may encroach no more than two feet into the required side setback.
3.  _Rear setback_. A required rear setback is measured at a right angle from the rear setback line to the nearest point on the foundation wall. Eaves may encroach no more than two feet and a deck or porch of no more than 16 square feet total area may encroach no more than four feet.

[153.58 Off-Street Parking Standards](https://choteau.municipalcodeonline.com/book?type=ordinances#name=153.58_Off-Street_Parking_Standards)

1.  _Purpose_. The purpose of these standards is to provide functional parking areas with safe and efficient circulation patterns that are adequate to meet the needs of users while avoiding the negative environmental and urban design impacts that can result from parking lots and other vehicular use areas. The provisions of this section aim to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare by avoiding spillover parking into adjacent neighborhoods, lessening and/or mitigating traffic congestion, enhancing pedestrian safety, reducing stormwater runoff; improving air quality through dust abatement encouraging infill development, and providing flexible methods to respond to the transportation and access demands of various land uses in different areas of the community.
2.  _Applicability_. Generally, the standards set forth herein apply only to new construction, new expansions of existing building or land uses, and changes of land use that result in greater parking requirements.
    1.  Unless otherwise expressly stated, the parking standards of this section apply whenever an existing building or use is enlarged or expanded to include additional dwelling units, floor area, seating capacity, employees, or other units of measurement used for establishing off-street parking requirements.
    2.  In the case of enlargements, expansions, or land use changes that require additional parking, additional spaces are required only to serve the enlarged or expanded area, or in the case of a land use change, only the difference in spaces required between the old and new use. There is no requirement to address lawfully existing parking deficits unless the site is completely redeveloped.
3.  _Exemptions_. As set forth in § 153.31(G) of this chapter, within the Central Business District (CB), all lodging, governmental facilities, and residential development must provide parking according to the standards set forth in this section. All other uses in the CB are exempt from off-street parking requirements.
4.  _Calculation of space requirements_.
    1.  _Floor area_. When parking space requirements are based on floor area, the entire gross floor area in square feet must be calculated.
    2.  _Fractions_. When calculations of the required number of spaces results in a fraction of a space, any fraction (represented as a decimal) of less than 0.5 is rounded down to the nearest whole space. Any fraction of 0.5 or greater is rounded up to the next whole space.
    3.  _Mixed uses_. If more than one type of land use occupies a single structure or parcel of land where shared parking and access have been provided for, the total requirement for off-street parking shall be the sum of the requirements for all uses minus 10% of the total. If the peak parking demands of the various mixed uses occur on different days or at different times of the day, the land owner or developer may, upon producing relevant data and other evidence, request a reduction in the total parking requirement from the Zoning Administrator.
5.  _General requirements_.
    1.  _Location of parking spaces and access_.
        1.  All required parking spaces shall be on the same lot or an adjoining lot under the same ownership or lease with the principal building(s) that the parking serves.
        2.  In the A and B Residential and BR Zoning Districts, parking is prohibited in front and street side setbacks, except that parking spaces may be located in front of a garage or carport that is located outside of required building setbacks. No more than 40% of the front yard area in a residential district may be paved or used for the parking or storage of vehicles. On corner parcels, not more than 20% of the street side yard area may be paved or devoted to parking or other vehicle use.
        3.  In nonresidential districts, parking is permitted in all setbacks, provided it complies with standards for screening and landscaping. In no case shall a parking space be located such that it allows a vehicle to park across an external property line.
        4.  Except for one- and two-family dwellings, no parking area shall be designed and constructed such that vehicles are permitted to back into a street.
    2.  _Surface material_. All parking and drive areas within the city shall be surfaced with asphalt, concrete, or similar material, with an adequate subsurface base to produce a long lasting, durable, weatherproof surface. Exceptions to this standard are:
        1.  One- and two-family residential development, provided that all surfaces are kept dust free;
        2.  Any parking or drive area that is accessed from an unpaved alley or street;
        3.  At the discretion of the Zoning Administrator, spillover parking or other parking that is not used on a regular and/or frequent basis may be treated with “turf block”, “grasscrete”, or similar products that allow grass or ground cover to grow in spaces between the structure of the product while still supporting the weight of vehicles; and
        4.  Emergency access across open space or landscaped areas may be treated with products described in division (E)(2)(c) above, subject to approval of the Zoning Administrator and local Fire Department.
    3.  _Lighting_. For parking areas of eight or more spaces, lighting of the parking area and walkways shall be provided to a 1.5 foot-candle level of illumination. Light sources shall be directed downward and shall be shielded to prevent spillover lighting onto adjacent properties.
    4.  _Curb stops_. Where a vehicle overhang is adjacent to a walkway, landscaped area, or a wall, curb stops are required.
    5.  _Maintenance and use_. The maintenance of all parking and drive areas is the responsibility of the property owner. The following maintenance and use standards apply to required off-street parking.
        1.  Required off-street parking areas must be used solely for the temporary parking of licensed motor vehicles in operating condition.
        2.  Required off-street parking spaces may not be used for the display of goods for sale or lease.
        3.  Required off-street parking may not be used for open storage, storage of building materials, or storage of inoperable vehicles.
        4.  Off-street parking spaces must be maintained to be free of potholes, trash, debris, dirt, and dust.
        5.  No commercial motor vehicle repair work of any kind is permitted in a required parking space.
    6.  _Snow storage and drainage retention_. The design of parking facilities with area for snow storage, drainage retention, or, both functions within the same area, is encouraged by the city. Such areas may be provided within landscape areas and setbacks.
    7.  _Shared parking and shared access_. In any development where there are two or more businesses both using the same parking area and common points of access, the property shall be encumbered by a “shared parking, shared access” easement. This easement may be placed on the face of the plat, or may be filed by separate instrument. The Zoning Administrator may require proof of such an easement prior to, or as a condition of, a zoning permit.
6.  _Parking requirements by use_. The numbers of spaces required in this section are minimums and shall be maintained by ownership, easement, or lease, for as long as the land use which is served by the parking exists.
    1.  _Maximum number of spaces_. Provision of more than 125% of the minimum number of spaces required is not permitted.
    2.  _On-street parking_. No credit against the required off-street parking shall be allowed for on street spaces.
    3.  _Uses not specifically listed_. For uses not listed in the space requirements set forth in this subsection, the Zoning Administrator shall determine the appropriate requirement based upon any similar uses that are listed and/or upon research.
    4.  _Required off-street parking spaces_. The minimum number of parking spaces by land use is as follows:

7.  _Handicap accessible parking_.
    1.  _Handicap accessible spaces required_. Handicap accessible off-street parking shall be required according to the following schedule:  
          
        
| **Total Spaces Provided** | **Handicap Accessible Spaces (Minimum)** |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 5 to 20                   | 1                                        |

    2.  _Van accessible spaces_. One out of each eight accessible spaces provided, but at least one space in each parking facility, shall be van accessible.
    3.  _Location_. Accessible parking spaces shall be located so as to provide the shortest accessible route to a primary building entrance.
    4.  _Curb ramps and accessible routes_. Curb ramps and accessible routes shall be provided which allow unobstructed travel from an accessible parking space to an accessible entrance. Parked vehicle overhangs shall not reduce the clear width of an accessible route. Parking spaces and access aisles shall not exceed 2% grade in all directions.
    5.  _Signage_. Each accessible space shall be identified by a sign showing a universal symbol of accessibility (wheelchair).

[153.59 Design Standards](https://choteau.municipalcodeonline.com/book?type=ordinances#name=153.59_Design_Standards)

1.  _Residential design standards_.
    1.  _Orientation_. Each primary single-family detached residence shall have a main entry facing the street from which the structure is addressed and draws its legal access.
    2.  _Eaves_. All residential structures with pitched roofs shall have eaves not less than 12 inches.
    3.  _Facade materials_. Residential structures shall not be sided with materials that are decidedly industrial in character. Materials such as uncoated metal, unpainted block masonry, split faced masonry, and synthetic stucco may be used for trim or architectural embellishment, but may not be used as primary facade materials. Wood, brick, or stone (including synthetic stone) are preferred materials.
    4.  _Covered entryways_. The main entryway to a residential structure shall be shielded by a canopy, eave, or similar structure that extends from the exterior wall not less than four feet.
2.  _CB design standards and guidelines_.
    1.  _Purpose_. The purpose of this division is to set forth basic design standards for certain specific elements of downtown built environment. These standards are intended to protect the downtown’s unique character and qualities while stimulating and protecting investment, and allowing the architect or designer the latitude to develop a creative response to any design issue. Where standards use terms such as “must”, “required”, or “shall be”, they are mandatory. Where terms such as “encouraged”, “preferred”, “may” or “optional” are used, the standard is considered a guideline and is voluntary. These standards and guidelines apply to the central business zoning district only.
    2.  _Front setbacks and exceptions_. All primary structures are required to have a front setback from zero to five feet. The Zoning Administrator is empowered to grant an exception for a front setback of no more than 15 feet then the space between the principal structure and the front property line is designated on the zoning permit site plan as being used for outdoor dining, for public art, or for use as a plaza or other public gathering place. An increased front setback to allow parking in front of a structure is expressly prohibited.
    3.  _Exterior building materials_. Acceptable exterior building materials for the fronts (street facing) of primary structures include wood and manufactured woodgrain hardboard, brick, split faced block, decorative (painted or coated) metal siding, and stone, including manufactured stone. Acceptable materials for the sides and rear of primary structures and for accessory structures include smooth painted concrete or cinder block, finished metal siding of all types, synthetic stucco, exterior insulated finish system, and vinyl exterior finishes of all types.
    4.  _Exterior colors_. A wide variety of colors are acceptable in the CB District, including muted colors with a pastel or earth tone hue and all finished natural wood colors. Fluorescent or Day-Glo colors of any shade are prohibited. Bright and heavily saturated primary colors are encouraged for trim and architectural embellishments only.
    5.  _Entryways_. A building’s primary door and entrance shall be located in the principal facade of the structure, and shall be oriented toward the street. The primary entrance must be readily apparent as a prominent architectural component. Entryways should be recessed from the front property line so that patrons have a queuing area out of the pedestrian flow. The recessed area must be at a minimum one and one-half times the width of the door to avoid a corridor like effect. Doors shall permit clear two-way visibility, and wood and glass are preferable materials.
    6.  _Windows_. Street level windows are required of all structures, including the sides of structures occupying corner lots. Windows shall begin at least three feet above the sidewalk and may extend vertically to the top of the first level. Street level windows shall be designed to engage the pedestrian and invite visual inspection of the interior of the establishment, as well as to view displays of merchandise. Stenciled signage or other signage types that allow visual penetration through the lettering is encouraged. Reflective glazing is expressly prohibited. Windows may be recessed to allow patrons to view displays out of the pedestrian flow. Bay windows may not extend into the right-of-way (sidewalk area). Unframed windows are not permitted unless set into a brick or stone like facade.
    7.  _Modulation_. Segments of plain or uniformly treated storefronts that are out of context with adjacent or nearby buildings are prohibited. Such treatments may be avoided or mitigated through modulation. In architectural terms, modulation is a technique for visually dividing the facade so that it takes on the appearance of distinctly different structures or portions of structures. This architectural technique is used to add visual interest to long storefronts or to other structures that occupy a significant segment of a downtown block. Visual interest can also be achieved through repeating architectural features, such as windows and the elements that frame them, and through recesses, off-sets, and other variations in plane sufficient to add shadow lines or depth to the facade.
    8.  _Lighting_. Outside lighting should be minimal, and downtown businesses are encouraged to rely on ambient lighting provided by streetlights for the safe illumination of the sidewalk area. Low wattage lighting may be used to highlight an entryway provided no glare is cast out onto the sidewalk. Merchants are also encouraged to illuminate window displays and interior spaces provided that no glare is cast onto the sidewalk area. Flashing or strobe type lighting is prohibited.
    9.  _Fencing_. Chainlink and other types of metal fencing shall not be visible from the street or sidewalk.
3.  _BR design standards and guidelines_.
    1.  _Purpose_. The purpose of this division is to set forth basic design standards for certain specific elements of the business residential transition area that lies between the CB and the city’s traditional residential neighborhoods. Like the CB standards, these standards are intended to protect the character and qualities of the transition area, and stimulate investment while allowing the architect or designer the latitude to develop a creative response to any design issue. Where standards use terms such as “must”, “required”, or “shall be”, they are mandatory. Where terms such as “encouraged”, “preferred”, “may” or “optional” are used, the standard is considered a guideline and is voluntary. These standards and guidelines apply to the Business Residential Zoning District only.
    2.  _Exterior building materials_. The BR transition area is more residential in character than the CB, and this should be reflected in the choice of exterior materials. Acceptable building materials for the fronts (street facing) and sides of buildings include wood and manufactured woodgrain hardboard, brick, painted or coated metal siding, and stone, including manufactured stone. Acceptable materials for the rear of primary structures and for accessory structures include smooth painted concrete (prestress or block), finished metal siding of all types, synthetic stucco, exterior insulated finish system, and vinyl exterior finishes of all types.
    3.  _Exterior colors_. A wide variety of colors are acceptable in the BR transition area, including muted colors with a pastel or earth tone hue and all finished natural wood colors. Fluorescent or Day-Glo colors of any shade are prohibited. Bright and heavily saturated primary colors are encouraged for trim and architectural embellishments only.
    4.  _Entryways_. A building’s primary door and entrance shall be located in the principal facade of the structure, and shall be oriented toward the street. The primary entrance must be readily apparent as a prominent architectural component, and may include a porch, deck, or other outdoor living space, and merchandise may be displayed in this area. Secondary entries and exits may be provided at the sides and rear of buildings.
    5.  _Windows_. Lower level windows are required in all primary buildings, and shall be viewable by pedestrians on the public way in front of the property. Lower level windows shall be designed to engage the pedestrian and invite visual inspection of the interior of the establishment, as well as to view displays of merchandise. Stenciled signage or other signage types that allow visual penetration through the lettering is encouraged. Reflective glazing is prohibited, but awnings and window coverings to shade the morning or afternoon sun are allowed. Unframed windows are not permitted unless set into a brick or stone like facade.
    6.  _Lighting_. Outside lighting should be residential like in intensity and direction, and should be used primarily to highlight entryways and outdoor spaces. Direct glare visible from the public way and trespass lighting onto adjacent properties are prohibited.
    7.  _Fencing_. Chainlink and other types of metal fencing (except for wrought iron) shall not be visible from the adjacent street or sidewalk.
4.  _HB design standards and guidelines_.
    1.  _Purpose_. The purpose of this division is to set forth basic design standards for certain specific elements of the highway business areas of the city that lie mostly on the fringes of town and generally encompass the “gateway” areas of the community. These gateway areas most often establish a first and lasting impression of the community. Therefore, a uniformly high standard of planning and design for the built environment of these areas benefits the entire community. Like other standards in this chapter, these standards are intended to set planning and design benchmarks and to stimulate and protect private investment, while allowing the architect or designer the latitude to develop a creative response to any design issue. Where standards use terms such as “must”, “required”, or “shall be”, they are mandatory. Where terms such as “encouraged”, “preferred”, “may” or “optional” are used, the standard is considered a guideline and is voluntary. These standards and guidelines apply to the Highway Business Zoning District only.
    2.  _Exterior building materials_. A wide variety of exterior materials is acceptable for use in HB, including, but not necessarily limited to:
        1.  Stone, including synthetic stone;
        2.  Wood, both natural and woodgrain hardboard products;
        3.  Concrete and cinder block, provided it is painted;
        4.  Split face masonry;
        5.  Stucco/Dryvit finishes; and
        6.  Metal that is painted or otherwise coated. Unfinished metal or galvanized finishes are not acceptable, and Quonset style buildings are not acceptable in HB.
    3.  _Exterior colors_. A wide variety of colors are acceptable in the HB District, including muted colors with a pastel or earth tone hue and all finished natural wood colors. Fluorescent or Day-Glo colors of any shade are prohibited. Bright and heavily saturated primary colors are encouraged for trim and architectural embellishments only.
    4.  _Entryways_. A building’s primary door and entrance shall be located in the principal facade of the structure, and shall be oriented toward the street. The primary entrance must be readily apparent as a prominent architectural component, and may include a porch, deck, or other outdoor living space, and merchandise may be displayed in this area. Secondary entries and exits may be provided at the sides and rear of buildings.
    5.  _Windows_. Lower level windows are encouraged, but not required, in all primary buildings. Lower level windows should be designed to engage the pedestrian and invite visual inspection of the interior of the establishment, as well as to view displays of merchandise. Stenciled signage or other signage types that allow visual penetration through the lettering is encouraged. Reflective glazing is prohibited, but awnings and window coverings to shade the morning or afternoon sun are allowed. Unframed windows are not permitted unless set into a brick or stone like facade.
    6.  _Lighting_. Outside lighting should be of sufficient intensity and suitable for an environment in which both vehicles and pedestrians will be present. Parking lot lighting is encouraged, but industrial and highway type fixtures are not permitted. Maximum height of light standards should be no more than 20 feet, and cutoff luminaires are required. Lighting elsewhere should be used primarily to highlight entryways and outdoor spaces. Direct glare visible from the public way and trespass lighting onto adjacent properties are prohibited.

1.  _Status of nonconformities_. The adoption of the Zoning Code will mean that some lots, land uses, and structures that may have conformed to the prior code will not conform to the provisions and standards set forth in this code. This section provides the standards and requirements by which legal nonconforming lots, uses, and structures may be continued and even transferred. It is the city’s intent that the adoption of these regulations will render no legal lot of record “unbuildable”, and that any use which was legal and proper under prior regulations will continue to be legal and proper under these regulations.
    1.  Lots, uses, and structures that were legally nonconforming under prior regulations, and which do not conform to these regulations, remain legally nonconforming;
    2.  Lots, uses, and structures that were legal and conformed to prior regulations, but do not conform to these regulations, become legally nonconforming under these regulations;
    3.  Lots, uses, and structures which were not legal under prior regulations, and do not conform to these regulations, remain illegal under these regulations; and
    4.  Legally nonconforming lots and/or nonconforming lots with nonconforming structures, as well as nonconforming uses of land, may be transferred to heirs and assigns in a manner similar to any conforming lot, structure, or use.
2.  _Nonconforming lots_.
    1.  Legal lots of record that previously existed on the effective date of these regulations that do not conform to these regulations due to lot area, width, or other dimensional standard, may continue to exist as legally nonconforming lots under these regulations.
    2.  Nonconforming lots may be developed for any of the principal permitted, accessory, and conditional uses allowed by the applicable zoning district.
    3.  Nonconforming lots are subject to all standards of the applicable zoning district, including setbacks, floor area ratios, landscape ratios, and structural height limits.
3.  _Nonconforming land uses_.
    1.  Any land use that previously existed on the effective date of these regulations, conformed to the prior regulations, but does not conform to these regulations, may continue to exist as a legally nonconforming land use.
    2.  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged nor extended to occupy a greater area of land or structure than was occupied on the effective date of these regulations.
    3.  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied on the effective date of these regulations.
    4.  If any such nonconforming use is discontinued for any reason for a period of one year (calendar date to calendar date), or three years in the case of nonresidential uses in the B Residential District, any subsequent use of the subject property and/or structure shall conform to these regulations.
    5.  No additional structure not conforming to these regulations shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land or structures.
4.  _Nonconforming structures_.
    1.  Any structure that previously existed on the effective date of these regulations, which conformed to the prior regulations, but does not conform to these regulations in terms of height, setbacks, floor area ratio, landscape ratio, or other such standards, may continue to exist as a legally nonconforming structure under these regulations.
    2.  No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged, expanded, or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity, but may be altered to decrease its nonconformity.
    3.  Should such nonconforming structure be moved for any reason and for any distance, it shall thereafter conform to these regulations.
    4.  Should any nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of a structure be destroyed by any means to an extent greater than 50% of its floor area, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with these regulations.
    5.  Nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any structure or portion of a structure declared to be unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.
5.  _Nonconforming manufactured homes_.
    1.  Consistent with § 153.28 of this chapter, legally existing Class B and Class C manufactured homes in the A Residential Zoning District may only be replaced by a Class A manufactured home or a site built dwelling unit. In addition to this requirement, all Class B and C manufactured homes in the A Residential Zoning District are subject to applicable provisions from divisions (C) and (D) above.
    2.  Consistent with § 153.29 of this chapter, legally existing Class B and Class C manufactured homes in the B Residential Zoning District may only be replaced by a Class A or B manufactured home or a site built dwelling unit.

[153.63 Corner Visibility](https://choteau.municipalcodeonline.com/book?type=ordinances#name=153.63_Corner_Visibility)

1.  _Corner visibility triangle_. Every street intersection shall have associated with it a corner visibility triangle. This area shall be created by extending the curb lines (or edge of pavement where there are no curbs) to an imaginary point in the street where the lines intersect. From that point, 30 feet is measured back along each line, then a line across both ends is drawn to close the triangle. In most cases, this triangular area will include both public right-of-way and private property adjacent to the right-of-way.
2.  _Visibility standards_. Within the corner visibility triangle, there shall be no continuous obstructions between the heights of 30 inches and ten feet, as measured from the adjacent road surface. This includes landscaping, fencing, and structures of all kinds.
3.  _Applicability_. This standard applies to streets of all functional classifications, but does not apply to intersections of a street and an alley.

Major recreational equipment shall not be parked or stored in any required front or side yard other than a driveway that provides direct access from the street to a garage or carport. However, major recreational equipment may be parked anywhere on residential property for the purpose of loading or unloading for a period not to exceed 24 hours. Major recreational equipment may be parked or stored in bona fide commercial storage facilities that meet the standards of these regulations.

The Zoning Administrator shall provide written notice to the permittee once a permit expires. Should the permittee request in writing an extension of the zoning permit, the Zoning Administrator may grant such extension for not more than one year. Any such request for an extension must be made prior to the actual expiration of the zoning permit. The Zoning Administrator is not empowered to reinstate an expired zoning permit.

    1.  Conducted an inspection of the subject property;
    2.  Thoroughly investigated any complaints;
    3.  Contacted the permittee in writing notifying him or her of the nature of complaints, issues, and/or potential violations; and
    4.  Provided the permittee every reasonable opportunity to address and correct conditions, violations, or deficiencies.

    1.  That the initial application and/or representations made by the applicant in connection with the application were fraudulent or otherwise inaccurate or misleading to the extent that the decision to grant the zoning permit was based upon or influenced by said application or representations; and
    2.  That operation of the authorized use or development has become a public nuisance and/or an imminent threat to the public health, safety, and general welfare.

    6.  Any decision of the BOA may be appealed to district court as provided in MCA § 76-2-327. Notice of intent to file an appeal shall halt all proceedings by the Zoning Administrator to carry out the BOA decision, unless in the judgment of the Zoning Administrator, such action is imperative due to imminent public health or life safety concerns.
2.  When in the judgment of the Zoning Administrator, his or her decision or interpretation of the regulations will affect a specific property or class of properties, and/or have a potentially significant impact on a neighborhood or landscape of the city, the Zoning Administrator shall notify adjacent property owners via first class mail of his or her intent to render a decision or interpretation. The letter shall explain the pending decision and shall invite comment for a period of not less than 15 days following the date of the letter. At the end of this comment period, the Zoning Administrator may officially render the decision or interpretation, and communicate it in writing to all parties involved.

[153.84 Variances](https://choteau.municipalcodeonline.com/book?type=ordinances#name=153.84_Variances)

The Board of Adjustment (BOA) may, in specific cases, grant relief from the standards and requirements of these regulations as set forth in MCA § 76-2-323.

1.  The applicant shall apply for a variance on a form supplied by the city. The applicable filing fee shall be paid and all relevant supporting materials shall be submitted.

4.  The BOA shall conduct a hearing on the proposed variance following procedures set forth in the Board’s adopted rules of procedure. No hearing shall be conducted if the applicant or a representative is not present.
5.  In applying the provisions of MCA § 76-2-323(1)(c), the BOA may only grant relief upon a finding that the following criteria are met in substance as they may apply to the application:
    1.  The variance is necessitated due to exceptional and/or extraordinary circumstances or conditions that are unique to the subject property, and are not generally characteristic of similarly situated properties;
    2.  Approval of the variance(s) will preserve a property right or use that is generally enjoyed by owners of similarly situated properties, and conversely, approval of a variance will not bestow a special privilege on the applicant that is not generally enjoyed by the owners of similarly situated properties;
    3.  The alleged hardship has not been created by the applicant;
    4.  Specific relief from the code shall be the minimum necessary; and
    5.  Adverse impacts associated with granting relief from the code are avoided or effectively mitigated.
6.  Conditions may be imposed by the BOA that will cause the above criteria to be met.
7.  Final action is required on a variance request within 20 business days of the initial opening of the public hearing.
8.  The Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant and interested parties of the BOA decision in writing within five business days.
9.  Decisions of the BOA may be appealed to District Court as set forth in MCA § 76-2-327.
10.  Granting of a variance allows the applicant specific relief from the provisions of this code. Granting of a variance does not convey broad powers to deviate from other standards and requirements set forth herein.
